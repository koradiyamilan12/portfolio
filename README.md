# My Portfolio

Hi there! 👋

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects and skills. I built it using **React** and **Tailwind CSS** to keep things fast and looking good.

## Cool Stuff Inside

- 🎨 **Modern Design**: Clean and responsive layout.
- 📬 **Contact Form**: Working form using EmailJS.

## How to Run It

If you want to run this locally, just follow these steps:

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your EmailJS credentials (see `.env.example`):

   ```env
   VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
   VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
   VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   ```

3. **Start the dev server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

That's it! Open your browser and check it out. Thanks for visiting! 🚀
